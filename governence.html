 Pokhara University manages its expenditures mainly from three sources: Nepal Government’s grants, revenue from students and affiliated institutions. 
 PU has been gradually reducing its dependence on government coffer in line with Nepal Government’s fiscal policy of cost-effective sharing with private sectors. 
 However, it fully depends on government grants for financing the capital expenditure, especially on building infrastructures for academic and administrative purposes.
