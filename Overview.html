Pokhara University (PU or PoU) was established in 1996 as Nepal's fifth university. Its central office is in 
Pokhara, Kaski district, Western Development Region. Along with Purbanchal University, PU was formed as part of the government's policy for improved access to higher education. 
The prime minister is the university chancellor and the minister for education is the pro-chancellor. The vice chancellor is the principal administrator of the university.
A non-profit autonomous institution, PU is partly funded by the Government of Nepal and partly by revenues from its students and affiliated colleges.<br>
Pokhara University is located in Lekhnath Municipality of Kaski district, thirteen kilometer east to the heart of the Pokhara city. It has already built its academic complex in the serene 
and scenic location of seven lake city, Lekhnath, in the lap of the beautiful Himalayan range and peaks such as Mt. Machhapuchre and Mt. Annapurna. In addition,Begnas lake and Rupa lake 
are walking distance of its academic complex and central office. It is planning to develop the infrastructure for School of Engineering Sciences on the bank of Khudi River and School of 
Medical Sciences on the bank of Seti River, five minute walking distance from Prithivi High Way.
Local community is generous to endow the land in the scenic and beautiful location for other potential schools and research center such as School of Education and Sports, School of Tourism
